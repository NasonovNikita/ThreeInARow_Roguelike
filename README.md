# ThreeInARow_Roguelike
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game has a long way to go, fighting enemies in turn-based combat based on the well-known game "three in a row".
You will find weapons and spells that can outweigh your advantage in combat.
You can get them in shops and chests, but you need to choose them correctly, you can have a limited amount at a time!
Lost? It's OK! Respawn and start your journey from the very beginning, but everything around has changed: the location of enemies, rooms, etc.
